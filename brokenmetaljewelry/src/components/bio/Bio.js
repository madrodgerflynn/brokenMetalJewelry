                    Hello, my name is Tyler Anderson and this is my page. I figure I'll give you a little information about what I do. Working in the manufacturing/eCommerce industry I found all sorts of interesting scraps. It is with these scraps that I built my first necklace. From there it was all uphill. The training and practice has been difficult but incredibly enlightening. I aim to use scraps, to make things that seem trivial, beautiful.
